									<h3>Endodontics</h3>
									<p>The therapy of root canals is required in situations when the tooth infection spreads into  tooth nerve tissues where it has destructing effects on its structure. The tooth nerve lacks protection capacity and its extended exposure to bacterial toxins results in its necrosis. Without a dental surgeon´s intervention even at this critical stage, through the root canal the infection advances to the tooth´s adjacent areas and has an adverse effect on the jaw bone tissue.  Its ensuing invasion of the circulatory system threatens to upset the whole of the patient´s health.
									A timely pulpectomy and successful decontamination of the root canals saves the tooth and there is no need for the dentist to deliberate extraction</p>

									<h3>Dental Surgery</h3>

									<h3>Periodontology</h3>
									<p>Periodontology is the study of the specialized system known as periodontium. What this apparatus represents is a set of hard and soft tissues that supports your teeth. Its concomitant assignment consists in acting as a barrier to avert accumulation of bacteria, impurities and like malign matters. Bleeding gums is the typical sign of early stages of periodontitis – known also as gingivitis – accompanied by inflammation and bad breath. At final stages of the disease, the teeth become loose.</p>
